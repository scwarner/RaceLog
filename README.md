# My Finish Lines: An Online Race Log
### My September 2017 Code Louisville Full-Stack JavaScript Capstone

As a runner, I like to keep track of the races I complete. For my project, I decided to create an online log so that runners and walkers can save the details of their races, including name, distance, date and finishing time.

The project uses the MEAN stack, with JQuery filling in as the front-end framework. To handle responsivity, I used Bootstrap 4, which presented a bit of a learning curve since I was accustomed to Bootstrap 3.

Eventually, I would like to add user authentication and a list where runners and walkers could add races that are on their bucket list.

Here is how you can run my application:
* Clone or download the repository
* Go to the root directory of the project
* Run "npm install" to install Express and other dependencies
* Run "mongod"
* Enter "node src/app.js" in the command line
* Open browser and go to "localhost:3030"
